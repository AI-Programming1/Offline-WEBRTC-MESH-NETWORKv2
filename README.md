# Offline-WEBRTC-MESH-NETWORKv2
The program uses the webconnect.js library, which automatically handles peer discovery, offer/answer SDP exchanges, and connection establishment on the local network (same LAN/WiFi) without any manual steps or central server. It forms a mesh network where messages are relayed through connected peers.
The library can be found here: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/webconnect@0.0.10/dist/umd/webconnect.js
